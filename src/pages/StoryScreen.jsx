      <h2>The story you know so far</h2>
      <p className="text">
        You found out that you are not a human being, but a character made
        during one of the Writers Fights some time ago by a poet Deo. He then
        turned you into a free artificial creation browsing zerOne. A digital
        conscious being thinking of itself as of a real person. You had been
        stuck in a loop of taking part in Writers Fights on the second level of
        the Bridge until you found that all out. After that you almost won the
        last Fight, but decided to stop, to break that loop and get out of it.
        Another poet, Arika, who you met shortly before the Fight, got the first
        place. She somehow knew a lot about you and took you away somewhere,
        once the Fight was over. Now this is all you know. You donâ€™t have any
        clear direction or path to follow. Your past is a blurry notion which
        has never been yours, and your future has not yet come. Present moment
        is all you can be sure of. And even that is not certain. What will you
        do now, poet?
