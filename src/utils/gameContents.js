We’ve hidden inside, while making them higher and higher. But the sky is our limit now. Literally. We’ve created zerOne to escape from reality. But this reality won’t go anywhere. It’ll soon reach us and hit us hard, no matter how many new writers there are, no matter if we code more or less. We can hide but we can’t run. There’s simply no place to run to. Do you see it?”

    Arika points down, at the surface far beneath you. There are no toxic clouds shrouding what’s below. Now you can see it. Blurry image of the distant brown land speckled with dirty green spots all over it. Even from that distance you can almost feel the toxic air filling up your lungs, poisoning them, killing you. Suffocating touch of death on your throat. The wind is throwing needles of dust in your face, scratching, leaving long bloody lines all over it.

    You notice movement, myriads of dots all over the surface down below, shifting like a water surface in the storm, without any rest.

    “Machines.” - Arika follows your gaze. - “Searching for the remnants of our former life, scraping the last bits of resources the planet still has. They support the towers, rebuild them, but it’s getting slower and slower. There isn’t much left and what is left is being consumed both by us and them.” - Arika sighs. - “A grim picture, but I had to paint it for you, Soai. Deo asked me to guide you once you… well, get the idea of who you are.”

    You look around, observing the space. You sit on the narrow metal bar sticking from the tower’s wall like some forgotten piece after the construction work. The green and yellow clouds begin getting lower, surrounding you. The rain pours from above, dripping on the transparent umbrella Arika is holding above your heads. The drops are hissing on its surface like tiny angry creatures, not able to reach their prey.

    You turn around to her, watching a pair of yellow eyes watching you. Yellow hair is waving in the wind slightly.`,

All my life, however short or long it was, I thought I am a human like you. But, as it turns out, I am a bunch of code written by a dead man for some not quite clear purpose.”`,
    text: `Arika frowns at you.

    “You are as real as you can ever be. Human, non-human, why should this matter? You say you can feel and that’s what matters.” - She sighs again. - “It’s when you stop feeling, that’s when it becomes terrifying. Having no connection to the world around you is a scary thing, Soai. Try not to lose it.”

    Arika looks sad, thinking about something else, as if she is somewhere in a different place, far away. Then she shakes her head abruptly, smiles and continues in a cheerful voice.
    
    “Anywho, about this place. A while ago I managed to slip by the security systems in the real world and installed a camera right where we are sitting right now.” - She giggles and winks at you. - “So, we’re kinda watching the online feed. I did some tweaking, cleared the image a bit and so on. Well, I admit, this metal piece is somewhat smaller in reality, but, what’s funny, it’s still there. Can you imagine, with all the work and planning, they forgot about it somewhere along the construction. I like to come here from time to time and watch what’s still there, beneath us. The remains of our old home, which is now no more than a foundation, slowly collapsing and fading away.”`,
