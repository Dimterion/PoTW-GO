So, listen, a couple of clarifications before we start. This is sort of a continuation of the story I’ve made before. I’ve no idea if you read it or not, thus allow me to point out a few things.

If you’ve read through the previous story, first of all, thanks! Second of all, the current story takes place right after the end of the previous one. Also, I guess this may not be obvious, but this particular “end” that leads to this story is the one where you see “The End” words. Not sure if this is important, but here it is (just in case you’ve made different choices along the way back there). Hence, if you’ve reached “The End” there, you can skip the rest of the text on this page, unless you need a refresher. “Jump in” button will lead you to the beginning of the current story.

If you haven’t reached the end/haven’t read the previous story/etc. you can check the rest of the text on this page: first part is pretty much the same description of the world that is given for the initial story and the second one is a short version of the events that took place there.

I’m trying to make this one better, but want to stick to a similar structure, although who knows what it’ll look like at the end. Thing is, I just want to tell a story that has been sitting in me for many years. It may be good or bad or just ok-ish. Of that I’ve no idea, and, to be honest, I can’t say that I care much. It’s a strange reasoning, but the only one I have: I want to tell the story and put it somewhere. Well, I also try to become a better web developer (or just a developer if I may say so), but that remains to be seen.

Sorry for a bit of additional wording here, just thought it might be worth mentioning. In any case, if you’re reading this, wow, thank you. I really appreciate it. No idea if you’re going to continue reading or not, but everyone’s time is precious, so, in any case, I’m grateful you’ve spent a smidge of yours here. And just in case you intend to continue, cool, thanks again! Hope you’ll like it… though, no promises, alright? Ok, it’s better if I stop talking. Cheers!`;

export const storyScreenMainText = `In the distant future Earth's surface got fully toxic. The air became completely unbreathable. In a final desperate attempt to survive humans built lifescrapers - giant structures going high into the sky, the only place where it was still possible to live. They call them towers. The last attempt to save mankind which is fading away with each passing day.

Money and power are the two factors that define your fate in the tower. The more you have, the higher level of the lifescraper you can reach, increasing your chance for a longer life. The closer you are to the surface, the faster you die.

Slowly but surely the level of pollution and toxins is growing and getting up. One day it will finally reach the top levels of the highest towers.

Lifescrapers are not big enough to handle the birth rate, thus it’s heavily regulated. Movement between the towers is almost impossible. Only the richest ones have a chance to travel and visit other structures.

Each tower is a separate state while all of them are being ruled by the Builders Council. Its members developed and constructed all of them long ago. Their dynasties define humans' fate since then. They occupy the top level of the main lifescraper called the Pillar.

Not having enough space, jobs and money in the real world, humans spent most of the time in the virtual one. It’s a global network called zerOne, a virtual representation of the tower you live in. It provides more space but is still restricted in terms of getting higher or lower. Your financial situation is the main factor that can remove some of the restrictions. Connections with other towers are blocked, although there are some ways to bypass it.

At the time not long before the towers era, most of the humans’ jobs had been replaced by the machines and artificial intelligence. Not having a lot of other options, the majority of the Earth’s population became coders. The profession became so popular that it led to almost full replacement of all other types of activities. Coders call themselves writers based on what they do day after day.

Manual labor had ceased to exist. Builders Council controls the production of the machines and AI development. Writers form guilds that compete for each sector where their skills are still being used. Coders manage machines work, fix bugs, develop new features and compete with AI, endlessly trying to prove that they are worth it. However, the demand for them is significantly less than the population supply. Every writers’ guild is always fully staffed, and within them only the best ones manage to stay and continue working there.

Those who were not able to join the guilds search for any other source of income in zerOne. The most popular ones are Writers Fights, arenas where coders create and control artificial characters during the match. These characters fight each other in a special virtual space. Participants call themselves poets: for the majority every fight is the final frontier between the lower and higher tower’s levels. They call it the Last Song: the fight after which you either go down or rise up.`;

export const storyScreenSubText = `You are Soai, one of the poets. It wasn’t your choice to become one, it was a necessity.

The tower where you live is called the Bridge. It is divided into five levels. You are on the second one. One level below you won’t live long, one level above is a border between higher and lower society.

You’ve managed to stay on the current level for a while and haven’t been able to move any higher. Your performance during the Writers Fights is mediocre, but you don’t lose hope to get good.

Later on you found out that you are not a human being, but a character made during one of the Writers Fights some time ago by a poet Deo. He then turned you into a free artificial creation browsing zerOne. A digital conscious being thinking of itself as of a real person. You had been stuck in a loop of taking part in Writers Fights on the second level of the Bridge until you found that all out. After that you almost won the last Fight, but decided to stop, to break that loop and get out of it. Another poet, Arika, who you met shortly before the Fight, got the first place. She somehow knew a lot about you and took you away somewhere, once the Fight was over. Now this is all you know. You don’t have any clear direction or path to follow. Your past is a blurry notion which has never been yours, and your future has not yet come. Present moment is all you can be sure of. And even that is not certain.`;
