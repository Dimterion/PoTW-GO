Oh, hi. You’ve clicked me. Nice!

So, listen, a couple of clarifications before we start, ok?

This is a continuation of the story I’ve written before. I’ve no idea if you’ve read it or not, thus allow me to point out a few things.

If you’ve read through the previous story, first of all, thanks! Second of all, the current one takes place right after it. The particular “end” that leads to this story is the one where you see “The End” words (in case you’ve made different choices along the way back there). Hence, if you’ve reached “The End” there, you can skip the rest of this page, unless you need a refresher. “Jump in” button will lead you to the beginning of the current story.

If you haven’t reached the end/haven’t read the previous story/etc, you can check the summary on this page: “World state” button will show you some general info on what’s going on, and “Who you are” button will provide a brief recap of the events that took place before.

If you’re still reading this, thank you again. I really appreciate it. Everyone’s time is precious, and I’m grateful you’ve spent a smidge of yours here. And just in case you intend to continue, cool! Hope you’ll like it… though, no promises, alright?

Ok, it’s better if I stop talking. Cheers!

In the distant future Earth's surface got fully toxic. The air became completely unbreathable. In a final desperate attempt to survive humans built lifescrapers - giant structures going high into the sky, the only place where it was still possible to live. They call them towers. The last attempt to save mankind which is fading away with each passing day.

Money and power are the two factors that define your fate in the tower. The more you have, the higher level of the lifescraper you can reach, increasing your chances for a longer life. The closer you are to the surface, the faster you die.

Slowly but surely the level of pollution and toxins is growing and getting up. One day it will finally reach the top levels of the highest towers.

Lifescrapers are not big enough to handle the birth rate, thus it’s heavily regulated. Movement between the towers is almost impossible. Only the richest ones have a chance to travel and visit other structures.

Each tower is a separate state while all of them are ruled by the Builders Council. Its members developed and constructed the lifescrapers long ago. Their dynasties define humans' fate since then. They occupy the top level of the main tower called the Pillar.

Not having enough space, jobs and money in the real world, humans spend most of the time in the virtual one. It’s a global network called zerOne, a digital representation of the tower you live in. It provides more space but is still restricted in terms of getting higher or lower. Your financial situation is the main factor that can remove some of the restrictions. Connections with other towers are blocked, although there are ways to bypass this.

At the time not long before the towers era, most of the humans’ jobs had been replaced by the machines and artificial intelligence. Not having a lot of options, the majority of the Earth’s population became coders. The profession became so popular that it led to almost full replacement of all other types of activities. Coders call themselves writers based on what they do day after day.

Manual labor had ceased to exist. Builders Council controls machines production and AI development. Writers form guilds that compete for each sector where their skills are still being used. Coders manage machines work, fix bugs, develop new features and compete with AI, endlessly trying to prove that they are worth it. However, demand for them is significantly lower than supply. Each guild is always fully staffed, and within them only the best ones manage to stay and continue working there.

Those who were not able to join the guilds search for any other source of income in zerOne. The most popular one is taking part in the Writers Fights, arenas where coders create and control artificial characters that fight each other in a special virtual space. Participants call themselves poets: for the majority every fight is the final frontier between lower and higher towers levels. They call it the Last Song: a fight after which you either go down or rise up.

You are Soai, one of the poets. It wasn’t your choice to become one, it was a necessity.

The tower where you live is called the Bridge. It is divided into five levels. You are on the second one. One level below you won’t live long, one level above is a border between higher and lower society.

You’ve managed to stay on the current level for a while, but haven’t been able to move any higher. Your performance during the Writers Fights is mediocre, but you don’t lose hope to get good.

Later on you found out that you are not a human, but a character made during one of the Writers Fights some time ago by a poet Deo. He then turned you into a free artificial creation browsing zerOne. A digital conscious being thinking of itself as of a real person. You had been stuck in a loop of taking part in Writers Fights on the second level of Bridge until you figured it all out with the help of the Event Horizon, some sort of a software installed into you by Nnif, Deo’s friend. After that you almost won the last Fight, but decided to stop, to break the loop and get out of it. Another poet, Arika, who you met shortly before the arena, got the first place. She seemed to know a lot about you and took you away somewhere, once the Fight was over.

This is all you know for now. You don’t have any clear direction or path to follow. Your past is a blurry notion which has never been yours, and your future has not yet come. Present moment is all you can be sure of. And even that is not certain.
